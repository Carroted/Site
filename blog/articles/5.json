It features Carroted games and links to download them, purchase them and directly play them if they're web games.<br><br>\n\nThe \"Pylon Pixel\" link in the header has been replaced with a link to the games page, which itself contains a link to Pylon Pixel.<br><br>\n\nI hope you like the new page!"}
