Welcome to the blog post maker for Carroted members or guest writers!<br><br>If you aren't a Carroted member or invited
writer, this might not be of much use to you, unless you're making your own blog using
the Carroted Blog code as a base.<br><br>

Please fill out the following fields with your article's info and content! You can use an HTML editor if you want, such
as <a href="https://html-online.com/editor/">https://html-online.com/editor/</a>, or just manually write HTML for extra
customization.<br><br>

Once done, just send the downloaded file to me (Alex) on Discord! I'll add it to the blog.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br><br>
